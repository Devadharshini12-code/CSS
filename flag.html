    <h5>Republic Day history
        India gained freedom from British rule on 15 August 1947, but it was on 26 January 1950 that the Constitution of India came into force. This new Constitution replaced the Government of India Act, 1935, which was a colonial-era law, and established India as a fully independent republic.
        
        The date 26 January was chosen to honour the Purna Swaraj declaration made in 1930 by the Indian National Congress, which called for complete independence from British rule. The Constitution, prepared under the guidance of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, was finalised on 26 November 1949 and implemented on 26 January 1950.</h5>
